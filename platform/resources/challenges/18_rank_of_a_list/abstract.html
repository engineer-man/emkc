        <p>
            Suppose each list (containing an odd number of elements) is divided into a number of ranks that equals the index
            of its middle element. For example:
            <div class="input">
                [12, 67, 9, 12, 9, 5, 8, 7, 3, 2, 5]
            </div>
            is divided into 5 ranks since the index
            of its middle element (5) is 5.
        </p>
        <p>
            The ranks are ordered descendingly and each rank consists of two values.
            These two values can be found by moving one element to the left and one element to the right starting from the
            middle element. Using the previous example list we would get the following ranks and their values:
            <div class="input">
                Rank 5: (9, 8)<br />Rank 4: (12, 7)<br />Rank 3: (9, 3)<br />Rank 2: (67, 2)<br />Rank 1: (12, 5)
            </div>
        </p>
        <p>
            Your job is to find the largest rank (and its values) at which a combination of summations and/or subtractions
            can be performed to the product of its values and the product of the values of the ranks after it (if found)
            and the middle element number resulting in zero.
        </p>
        <p>
            Taking the previous list into example again while starting from the middle element then performing the
            operations on Rank 5, then on Rank 5 and Rank 4, then on Rank 5, Rank 4 and Rank 3, etc. We will find that:
            <div class="input">
                5 + 9 * 8<br />5 - 9 * 8
            </div>
            are not equal to zero, so the rank can never be 5.<br />Similarly:
            <div class="input">
                5 + 9 * 8 + 12 * 7<br />5 - 9 * 8 + 12 * 7<br />5 + 9 * 8 - 12 * 7<br />5 - 9 * 8 - 12 * 7
            </div>
            are not equal to zero, so the rank can never be 4, and so on.
        </p>
        <p>
            However,
            <div class="input">
                5 + 9 * 8 + 12 * 7 - 9 * 3 - 67 * 2
            </div>
            is equal to 0, and the final two numbers in the operation (67, 2) are in
            Rank 2, so our rank would be 2 and our output would be:
            <div class="input">
                2,67,2
            </div>
            (where the first number is the number of the rank,
            and the two numbers following it are the values of the rank).
            If there is not rank that satisfies this, then our rank would be 0.
        </p>

        <li>The number of elements of the list is always an odd number.</li>

        <h4 class="f300">Explanation</h4>
        This list consists of 3 ranks which are:
        <div class="input">
            Rank 3: (6, 8)<br />Rank 2: (5, 2)<br />Rank 1: (5, 9)
        </div>
        By performing the operations we can find out that:
        <div class="input">
            7 + 6 * 8 - 5 * 2 - 5 * 9
        </div>
        is the combination that gives 0.<br />
        The last two numbers in the operation (5, 9) are in Rank 1. So, our output would be 1,5,9

        This list only contains one rank
        <div class="input">
            Rank 1: (2, 3)
        </div>
        We can see that
        <div class="input">
            1 + 2 * 3<br />1 - 2 * 3
        </div> 
        are not equal to zero and this is the smallest (and only rank), so there
        can never be a rank for this list; hence we print out 0.
